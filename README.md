using ai meta library brainjs to build a machine learning model


brainjs: GPU accelerated Neural Networks in JavaScript, for Browsers and Node.js.

## Machine Learning - Colors

## The Goal
Use an AI library to make predictions for what color text to use, given the background color provided

## Technology Stack:


| Technology    	| Use           	  | Description     										  |
| :------------------|:-------------------| :----------------										  |
| BrainJS 			| AI     | PU accelerated Neural Networks in JavaScript, for Browsers and Node.js.


## Project Specifications
Train AI to know what color to make text overlaying a colored background.

The color of the text will be either white or black, depending on what the AI thinks is best.

-allow user to select white or black

-store the user selections

-use the stored selections as data for further decisions

## Anatomy of Project


| File/Folder    	| Purpose           	  |
| :------------------|:-------------------|
| index.html	 			| structure, presentation     |
| script.js		 			| JavaScript code|
| xor-test/		 			| preliminary ai testing    |
